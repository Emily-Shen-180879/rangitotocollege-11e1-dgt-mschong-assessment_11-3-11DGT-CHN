    <div class="history">History of Art
        <p>Art is an expressive form of creativity, communication, imagination, skill, and human experiance. It is a way for people to express their emotions and experiences in a non-verbal way.</p>
        <p>Art can be traced all the way back to the Prehistoric era. Some of the earliest artifacts come from the Paleolithic era, or the Old Stone Age. They often came in the form of rock carvings, engravings, pictorial imagery, sculptures, and arrangements.
          Prehistoric existed from around 40,000-4,000 B.C. During this period, people relied on natural pigments and stone carvings to create artworks.</p>
        <p>As time progressed, so did art, from 4,000 B.C-A.D. 400 Ancient art was produced by advanced civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Greece, Egypt, and those of the Americas.</p>
        <p>This evolved to Medieval art, which spanned from 500-1400. In this period, the art produced often reflected the darkness, characterized by brutal scenery and grotesque imagery.
          The art during this time  were centered around the Church and religion. This period was also responsible for the emergence of Gothic architecture.</p>
        <p>Following that, came Renaissance Art spanning from 1400-1600. Artwork in this period focused on nature and individualism. The art was characterized by realism, attention to detail, and study of human anatomy.
          Artists often used linear perspective and created depth through shading and lighting. The clash between Christianity and humanism eventually gave way to Mannerism.</p>
        <p>Following that, was the Baroque period, which lasted from 1600-1750. Intense contrast between light and dark was a characteristic often seen in this period, creating a dramatic effect. Artworks were commonly depicted with over-the-top visual arts and architecture.</p>
        <p>Next came the Rococo period (1699-1780), originating from Paris. Artworks in this period offered a softer style, characterized by elegance and lightness compared to the intensity of Baroque art.</p>
        <p>Next came the Neoclassical period spanning from 1750-1850. In this period, archaeological discoveries from ancient Athens and Naples were discovered, inspiring artists to recreate the artworks.
          Art in this period were influenced by classical elements, in particular, a heavy focus on idealism.</p>
          <p>Moving on is Romanticism (1780-1850), which emerged in reject of Neoclassism. Artists focused on emotion, passion, and sensation over reason and intellect.</p>
          <p>Realism (1848-1900) is arguabaly the first modern art movement, beginning in France. This art movement aimed to capture everyday life without idealization.</p>
          <p>Fauvism (1900-1935) was a short lived art movement led by Henri Matisse. It was built upon examples from Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.</p>
          <p>In the years 1916-1950, surrealism emerged, showcasing artworks that defied reason. Artists were influenced by Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, who explored the power of imagination and psychoanalysis.</p>
          <p>In the 1950s-1960s, Pop Art became a thing, characterised by its use of everyday mundane objects to create innovative pieces that challenged consumerism and mass media.</p>
          <p>Minimalism became a thing in the 1960s-1970s, where a group of young artists sought to challenge the expressive works of Abstract Expressionist artists. They focused on anonymity. They urged viewers to focus on what is in front of them
            rather than searching for hidden meanings.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Contemporary Art came to light in the 1970s and extends to the present day. In this period many smaller movements emerged throughout the years.</p>
